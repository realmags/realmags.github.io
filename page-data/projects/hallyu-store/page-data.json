To help the owners manage orders, the orders are received and aggregated in a spreadsheet file using the Google Sheets API. This allowed the owners to conveniently organize the status of each order.\n\nThe design of the website also took many inspirations to increase user experience. Red is the main color of the website as this color is commonly associated with food—think Jollibee or McDonald's. Also, the products are strategically laid out so customers can view them in a glance. Plus, the modal for the delivery details was designed to not impede with user experience: it is easy to close, short, and does not occupy the whole page. And of course, the solution would not be complete if it was not mobile responsive, considering that most shoppers are mobile users.","challenge":"Hallyu Store is an online business that offers   a selection of Korean food including kimchi, binggrae, and a DIY ramen set. The unique circumstances of COVID meant they had to capitalize on the growing number of people doing their shopping online. To accommodate online consumers, they wanted a comprehensive online ordering solution where their customers can browse and select products.\n\nThe first option was to accept orders through DMs in Facebook and Instagram. However, this option can be tedious for the customers and owners alike. Another option for taking orders was to use Google Forms which is similarly tedious and is such an inconveniently long process. Besides user experience, the decision for creating the online menu was tied to the timeline and budget constraints of a starting business.","thumbnail":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f53d061617f6e1d6eae1405f1826da81/d3cec/Hallyu%20Store%20home%20page.png.png","srcSet":"/static/f53d061617f6e1d6eae1405f1826da81/e8d73/Hallyu%20Store%20home%20page.png.png 100w,\n/static/f53d061617f6e1d6eae1405f1826da81/66db6/Hallyu%20Store%20home%20page.png.png 199w,\n/static/f53d061617f6e1d6eae1405f1826da81/d3cec/Hallyu%20Store%20home%20page.png.png 398w,\n/static/f53d061617f6e1d6eae1405f1826da81/5e94a/Hallyu%20Store%20home%20page.png.png 796w","sizes":"(min-width: 398px) 398px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/f53d061617f6e1d6eae1405f1826da81/99907/Hallyu%20Store%20home%20page.png.webp 100w,\n/static/f53d061617f6e1d6eae1405f1826da81/993dd/Hallyu%20Store%20home%20page.png.webp 199w,\n/static/f53d061617f6e1d6eae1405f1826da81/3638b/Hallyu%20Store%20home%20page.png.webp 398w,\n/static/f53d061617f6e1d6eae1405f1826da81/1cb49/Hallyu%20Store%20home%20page.png.webp 796w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 398px) 398px, 100vw"}]},"width":398,"height":601}}},"fileName":"Hallyu Store home page.png"},"gallery":[{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f2b3e7c8f9039c259c42265de5d013ce/d3cec/Hallyu%20Store%20delivery%20page.png.png","srcSet":"/static/f2b3e7c8f9039c259c42265de5d013ce/e8d73/Hallyu%20Store%20delivery%20page.png.png 100w,\n/static/f2b3e7c8f9039c259c42265de5d013ce/66db6/Hallyu%20Store%20delivery%20page.png.png 199w,\n/static/f2b3e7c8f9039c259c42265de5d013ce/d3cec/Hallyu%20Store%20delivery%20page.png.png 398w,\n/static/f2b3e7c8f9039c259c42265de5d013ce/5e94a/Hallyu%20Store%20delivery%20page.png.png 796w","sizes":"(min-width: 398px) 398px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/f2b3e7c8f9039c259c42265de5d013ce/99907/Hallyu%20Store%20delivery%20page.png.webp 100w,\n/static/f2b3e7c8f9039c259c42265de5d013ce/993dd/Hallyu%20Store%20delivery%20page.png.webp 199w,\n/static/f2b3e7c8f9039c259c42265de5d013ce/3638b/Hallyu%20Store%20delivery%20page.png.webp 398w,\n/static/f2b3e7c8f9039c259c42265de5d013ce/1cb49/Hallyu%20Store%20delivery%20page.png.webp 796w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 398px) 398px, 100vw"}]},"width":398,"height":601}}},"fileName":"Hallyu Store delivery page.png"},{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5bfb13119c9adb9e7bb7a87804ea01bb/d3cec/Hallyu%20Store%20order%20page.png.png","srcSet":"/static/5bfb13119c9adb9e7bb7a87804ea01bb/e8d73/Hallyu%20Store%20order%20page.png.png 100w,\n/static/5bfb13119c9adb9e7bb7a87804ea01bb/66db6/Hallyu%20Store%20order%20page.png.png 199w,\n/static/5bfb13119c9adb9e7bb7a87804ea01bb/d3cec/Hallyu%20Store%20order%20page.png.png 398w,\n/static/5bfb13119c9adb9e7bb7a87804ea01bb/5e94a/Hallyu%20Store%20order%20page.png.png 796w","sizes":"(min-width: 398px) 398px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/5bfb13119c9adb9e7bb7a87804ea01bb/99907/Hallyu%20Store%20order%20page.png.webp 100w,\n/static/5bfb13119c9adb9e7bb7a87804ea01bb/993dd/Hallyu%20Store%20order%20page.png.webp 199w,\n/static/5bfb13119c9adb9e7bb7a87804ea01bb/3638b/Hallyu%20Store%20order%20page.png.webp 398w,\n/static/5bfb13119c9adb9e7bb7a87804ea01bb/1cb49/Hallyu%20Store%20order%20page.png.webp 796w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 398px) 398px, 100vw"}]},"width":398,"height":601}}},"fileName":"Hallyu Store order page.png"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"Post:ckzl40wj45rba0d94i1es87bn:PUBLISHED"}},
